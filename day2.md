# **Day2:**

I dive a little deeper into DevOps and nana's videos gave a good introduction to dissect it.

Mere observing the word "DevOps" indicates a division into two parts, Dev - Development and Ops- operations.

- Michael explicitly explains that every application begins with the development (Developers will create an application, this can be done with many different technology stacks, and let us leave that to the imagination for now as we get into this later. This can also involve many different programming languages, build tools, code repository, etc.)

- He clearly stated that a DevOps engineer may not need to program an application but you must know how they work, linked together and the entry/ exit points.

- With development settled, the operations team needs to get this application online and continuously manage it to aid high security and availability.

To continuously deploy and maintain this application without making the end-user know that this process is going on, some form of technology/tools is required.

*Some important questions are:*

``` code

How do we get those features and bug fixes into our production and make it available to those end users?

How do we release the new application version?
```

This is one of the major tasks for a DevOps engineer, and the important thing here is not to just figure out how to do this once but we need to do this continuously and in an automated, efficient way which also needs to include testing!

=====> More of this will be discussed on day 3

However, I learned a lot from this video here [What is DevOps? - TechWorld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yWAtQ6wYNM)

See you on Day3
