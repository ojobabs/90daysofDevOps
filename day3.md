# Day 3

* This is getting better and better every day.

We discussed on the major purpose why DevOps is needed which is automation continuously running in a loop

￼

## Continuous development

As a DevOps engineer, remember you are probably not the one creating this plan or coding the application for the end-user, this will be a skilled developer. However, understanding the code is a recommended skill as this will make life easier for everyone. It will guide in making infrastructure decisions and speed up work with the development team.

## Continuous testing

At every stage of development, testing is a necessary step. This is why unit testing is a very important part required in a production environment, we must test each unit of code.

This also aids the micro-services style of code development whereby each unit is built to work individually without depending on another.

## Continuous integration

With every commit, your application can go through the automated testing phases and this allows for early detection of issues or bugs before the next phase.

## Continuous monitoring

Things are moving fast here and we have our Application that we are continuously updating with new features and functionality and we have our testing making sure no gremlins are being found. We have the application running in our environment that can be continually keeping the required configuration and performance. We need to continually monitor the CPU usage, disk usage, users and number of page visits, back door access, etc

## Continuous deployment (I froze here)

This is the stage where the code is deployed to the production servers, now this is where things get extremely interesting and it is where the rest of our 86 days dives deeper into these areas.

The videos are super simple to understand, I’m yet to digest all, but I will update the note as soon as I fully grasp each concept.
