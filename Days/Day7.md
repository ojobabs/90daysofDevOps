``` go

Permit me to open with this "To be successful in DevOps you have to have a good knowledge of programming skills is my takeaway from that at least. But we have to understand why we need it to choose the right path."

```

Understanding at aleast one programming language makes life simple as a Devops engineer, rememeber ***Infrastructure as a code*** (IAC)

### The Idea behind learning a programming Language

If you are going to be building DevOps tools or you are joining a team that does then it would make sense to learn that same language, if you are going to be heavily involved in Kubernetes or Containers then it's more than likely that you would want to choose Go as your programming language.

***I will just stay with my python, Go can come later***

Having a broad knowlegde of a programming language gives you an edge over other languages. You will master at your tools and use the same insight to advise developers on staying with the best practices that fit in with Devops.

- My javascript as at present is sleek, I guess I need to pick Python again and run with Go after that.

## Why Go?

Why Golang is the next programming language for DevOps, Go has become a very popular programming language in recent years. According to the StackOverflow Survey for 2021 Go came in fourth for the most wanted Programming, scripting and markup languages with Python being top but hear me out. [StackOverflow 2021 Developer Survey â€“ Most Wanted Link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)

As I have also mentioned some of that most known DevOps tools and platforms are written in Go such as Kubernetes, Docker, Grafana and Prometheus.

What are some of the characteristics of Go that make it great for DevOps?

## Go Vs Python
- Go Programs are statically linked, this means that when you compile a go program everything is included in a single binary executable, no external dependencies will be required that would need to be installed on the remote machine, this makes the deployment of go programs easy, compared to python program that uses external libraries you have to make sure that all those libraries are installed on the remote machine that you wish to run on. 

- Go is a platform-independent language, which means you can produce binary executables for *all the operating systems, Linux, Windows, macOS etc and very easy to do so. With Python, it is not as easy to create these binary executables for particular operating systems. 

- Go is a very performant language, it has fast compilation and fast run time with lower resource usage like CPU and memory especially compared to python, numerous optimisations have been implemented in the Go language that makes it so performant. (Resources below) 

- Unlike Python which often requires the use of third party libraries to implement a particular python program, go includes a standard library that has the majority of functionality that you would need for DevOps built directly into it. This includes functionality file processing, HTTP web services, JSON processing, native support for concurrency and parallelism as well as built-in testing. 

- This is by no way throwing Python under the bus I am just giving my reasons for choosing Go but they are not the above Go vs Python it's generally because it makes sense as the company I work for develops software in Go so that is why. 

**I will say that once you have or at least I am told as I am not many pages into this chapter right now, is that once you learn your first programming language it becomes easier to take on other languages. You're probably never going to have a single job in any company anywhere where you don't have to deal with manage, architect, orchestrating, debug JavaScript and Node JS applications.**
