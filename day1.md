Day 1:

It's a great opportunity to learn on this #90DaysofDevops, thank you @.

Day 1 of our 90 days and adventure to learn a good foundational understanding of DevOps and tools that help with a DevOps mindset.

So what's DevOps all about? I read the article below and I know the length, breath and height of what I am expected to understand

More than before, I clearly understand what Devops is not. 

1.  DevOps is not a tool. You cannot buy it. It is not a software sku or an open-source GitHub repository you can download. 
2.  It is also not a programming language.
3.  It is also not some dark art magic either.

If the points above are clear, then what is DevOps?

DevOps is a way to do smarter things in Software Development

*I will expand this in the future, but let's stop here for today.

He explained more that DevOps is a set of practices that help to achieve the goal of this movement: reducing the time between the ideation phase of a product and its release in production to the end-user or whomever could be an internal team or customer.

To sum this up, deploying effective / efficient solutions through automation

I rounded the day up with the videos below.
